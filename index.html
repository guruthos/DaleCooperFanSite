        <p>Dale Bartholomew Cooper was born on April 19, 1954 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. From an early age, Dale showed signs of being both introspective and curious. This inquisitive personality shaped his youth and ultimately led him to pursue a career with the FBI.</p>
        <p>While having a very analytical mind, Dale was also highly intuitive and open to what his subconscious was saying through dreams and visions. This curiosity about the unknown helped form his interest in the world of the mystical, which is evident in his unconventional investigative approach.</p>
        <p>At a young age, Cooper's mother impressed upon him the importance of both listening to and trusting ones dreams, inferring that dreaming is another way of seeing, one that allows us to see things "that we can't see when we're awake."</p>

        <p>Dale and his mother had a strong connection to each other through their dreams. When he was 14, Dale suffered an asthma attack and dreamt that a man was trying to break into his room, chanting his name and roaring like an animal. When he described his dream to his mother, she told him that she was aware of this man, and that he should never let him in his room. Nearly a year later, she had a dream of the same man, and told Cooper that this time the man "almost got in the door." Two weeks later, she suffered a stroke and died shortly after.

      <div class="text-left">
        <p>In February 1989, now a Special Agent of the FBI, Dale arrived in the town of Twin Peaks, Washington to investigate the murder of the local homecoming queen named Laura Palmer. During the investigation, Agent Cooper experienced many strange dreams and visions that he used as clues to help solve the murder. While the case was open, both Dale and the small town of Twin Peaks suffered and witnessed many tragedies and personal setbacks. Some residents harbored ill-will toward him, believing that he brought bad luck with him to their rural paradise.</p>
        <p>While recovering from an incident where he was shot by a suspect in his hotel room, Dale reported that he had a vision of a giant man, who spoke to him in cryptic prophesies and took his ring, promising to return it when the prophesies came true. Cooper believed the giant, trusting that following his inuition would help him solve the murder.</p>
        <p>The investigation led Agent Cooper, along with local law enforcement, to question a man named Philip Gerard. Mr. Gerard appeared to be unaware of anything related to the case, and was let free, only to surface again with circumstancial ties to the case. It was discovered that Philip regularly needed to take Haloperidol, a powerful drug used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia. Under questioning again by Cooper and his team, he was denied access to this drug. This caused Mr. Gerard to "change" into someone named Mike. He spoke as Mike, claiming to be what he referred to as an "inhabiting spirit," using Philip Gerard as a host. Mike then revealed that there is another spirit similar to himself, named Bob, who was bent on evil and must be stopped.</p>

             alt="Leland Palmer staring">
        <p>Following Mike's lead, a suspect in the murder was arrested. While the suspect was in custody, however, the original murder victim's cousin was also killed under nearly-identical circumstances. Madeline Ferguson, the latest victim, had such a strong resemblance to Laura Palmer that many thought they were sisters. This, along with the strikingly similar details in the murders, among other factors, led Cooper to believe the original killer, "Bob," was not yet apprehended.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the investigative team arrested Laura Palmer's Father, Leland, for his daughter's and Madeline's murder. While in policy custody, Mr. Palmer inflicted severe injuries to himself when he repeatedly rammed the locked cell door with his head. As he was dying, he was accompanied by Agent Cooper and other members of local law enforcement. Leland admitted to not only the killings of his daughter and neice, but also an earlier murder in a neighboring town of a woman named Teresa Banks. Leland claimed to be under the control of someone else, and could not recall the heinous acts he committed while under his influence. After Mr. Palmer's confession and death, the case seemed to come to a close.</p>

        <p>Shortly after Leland Palmer's wake, while in pursuit of a former collegue who was a suspect in many ongoing cases, Dale Cooper went missing for approximately 24 hours in the woods just outside of Twin Peaks. Sheriff Harry S. Truman, who was the only person with Agent Cooper at the time of his day-long disappearance, reported that he watched Dale vanish into thin air, only to suddenly reappear in the same place 24 hours later.</p>
        <p>Shortly after a quick recovery in his hotel, Special Agent Dale Cooper suddenly left the town of Twin Peaks. His current whereabouts are unknown.</p>
